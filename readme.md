# Project YOMI (Working Title)

## Vision

An online multiplayer, synchronous turn-based fighting game for iOS/Android/Web with colorful visuals, uniquely stylized characters, and social features such as player profiles, leaderboards, and character customization.

## Tools

This project is being built on the Unity Engine, with Unity Netcode for GameObjects for the networking programming, and Unity Gaming Services handling the network services. Blender and Adobe Illustrator will be used for assets, with placeholders pulled from Mixamo until production assets are finalized.

## Project

The project consists primarily of "thrashing" while learning all of the new tools and technologies and rapidly building proofs of concept for features of the final game. I will be projectizing the efforts through GitHub Projects once I've moved out of this preliminary phase.
